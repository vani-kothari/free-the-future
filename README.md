Project Title: Climate Change Awareness Microsite – “Free the Future”
The Climate Change Microsite, titled “Free the Future”, is an interactive, responsive web project designed to spread awareness about climate change and encourage individual action through an immersive digital experience. As part of my UI/UX Design internship, this project not only demonstrates my technical skills in frontend development but also reflects my passion for environmental responsibility and meaningful design.

The microsite is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is fully responsive across devices—desktop, tablet, and mobile. Its design is rooted in simplicity, elegance, and clarity, ensuring that users of all age groups and backgrounds can engage easily. The visual palette is based on calming earth tones like deep teal, forest green, light aqua, and white, inspired by natural elements to maintain a theme of eco-awareness.

The homepage acts as an entry point with bold yet warm messaging to capture user attention. As users scroll, they encounter a 3D-style horizontal glass carousel showcasing climate facts, implemented with smooth infinite scrolling and center-zoom animations. This feature uses JavaScript to create an engaging, interactive storytelling element, where users can swipe through educational content in a memorable format.

The About section outlines the urgency of climate change and our mission to inspire grassroots-level participation. It leverages soft animations and minimalist typography to keep the user engaged without overwhelming them.

In the Take Action section, I designed a pledge feature using modal overlays. Visitors can select eco-friendly actions—like reducing plastic use, conserving water, or planting trees—and then “submit” their pledge. Upon submission, users are greeted with a custom “Thank You” overlay, which reinforces the message that every small action contributes to a bigger cause. These overlays are styled with a white background and contrasting bold text to emphasize clarity and visual comfort.

To enhance community involvement, the footer includes social media icons that link to verified climate-related profiles and organizations such as Greenpeace, EarthDay.org, and UN Climate Action. This provides users with direct access to credible resources and real-world movements they can join or follow.

Each section is connected through smooth scroll navigation, allowing seamless transitions from "Home" to "About", "Facts", "Solutions", and "Take Action". I ensured accessibility by using semantic HTML, proper color contrast, readable fonts, and keyboard navigation support.

This microsite exemplifies how design can create impact. Beyond aesthetics, it tells a story—one of responsibility, hope, and empowerment. It has been built with empathy, interactivity, and visual storytelling at its core. From concept and low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity mockups in Figma and final coded implementation in VS Code, every step was guided by user experience principles and emotional design.

This project has strengthened my abilities in responsive design, micro-interactions, modal overlays, animation techniques, and more importantly, designing with purpose. It reflects my belief that designers are changemakers, and even a small microsite can become a voice for the planet.
